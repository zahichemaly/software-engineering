in my case of choosing the Vehicle Maintenance and Mileage Tracker project:


Safety:
The system should include a real-time vehicle diagnostics feature that monitors critical components (e.g., brakes, engine, tires) and alerts users immediately in case of potential safety hazards, ensuring prompt maintenance and safety.

Security:
User data, including personal information and vehicle maintenance records, shall be encrypted with AES-256 encryption both at rest and during data transmission to protect against unauthorized access and data breaches.

Usability:
The user interface shall follow a responsive design approach, making it accessible and user-friendly on both desktop and mobile devices to enhance usability for a diverse range of users.

Flexibility:
The system shall allow users to customize maintenance schedules and reminders based on their specific vehicle types and usage patterns, providing flexibility to accommodate various vehicle types and user preferences.

Efficiency:
The system's server infrastructure shall be optimized for efficiency, ensuring quick response times for user interactions, with resource utilization monitored and fine-tuned regularly to minimize energy consumption and operational costs.
