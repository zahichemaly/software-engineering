**Availaibility: The system's availability resides in its ability to remain opeartional and accessible to users when needed: 
--> example: The online reservation system for a hotel should be accessible 24/7, allowing customers to book rooms at any time.

**Flexibility: The system's ability to adapt and accommodate changes or variations in requirements or environments.
--> example: The online shopping application should be flexible enough to support different payment gateways, allowing users to choose 
             their preferred method of payment (e.g., credit card, PayPal, bank transfer).
**Performance: The system's ability to meet response time and expectations concerning the mount of data being processed. (throughput)
-->example: The website should load pages within 2 seconds to provide a smooth user experience.

**Robustness: The system's ability to handle unexpected inputs or situations without failure.
-->example: The chatbot should handle unexpected user inputs and provide appropriate error messages or prompts to guide the user towards valid inputs.

**Reliability: The system's ability to perform its intended functions without failure.
--> example: The ticketing system should accurately track and process customer support requests, ensuring that no customer inquiries are missed or mishandled.

**Security: The protection of data, systems, and resources from unauthorized access or breaches.
--> example: The online payment gateway should use encrypted connections (HTTPS) and tokenization techniques to protect customer payment card information from unauthorized access.

**Fault Tolerance: The system's ability to continue functioning in the presence of faults or errors.
-->example: The system should have redundant servers to ensure uninterrupted operation in case of hardware failures

**Flexibility: The system's ability to adapt and accommodate changes or variations in requirements or environments.
-->example:  The data analysis software should allow users to import data from various file formats, such as CSV, Excel, or JSON, enabling flexibility in data sources.

**Interoperability: The system's ability to interact and exchange data with other systems or components.
-->example: The messaging app should support integration with popular social media platforms like Facebook Messenger and WhatsApp, allowing users to communicate across different messaging services.

**Maintainability: The ease with which the system can be modified, repaired, or enhanced.
-->example: The software code should be well-documented and follow a modular architecture, enabling developers to easily understand and maintain the codebase.
