Let's say we have an online shopping app that sells clothes:
the user should be able to see the cart and add  the items to it
the application should be able to read the card details and retrieve the according amount
the user should be able to retrieve items from the cart in case he/she doesn't want them anymore
an authentication system should be able to authenticate the user in order to access his/her account
the user should be able to track the order
