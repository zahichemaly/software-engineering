- Students
- Faculty and administrators

b. Objectives

- Automate the student attendance process.
- Improve attendance accuracy.
- Reduce the administrative burden of manual attendance tracking.
- Enhance data security and privacy.
- Provide real-time attendance information to faculty and administrators.

c. Constraints

- Compliance with data privacy regulations (e.g., GDPR, FERPA).
- Integration with existing student information systems (if applicable).
- Scalability to handle a large number of students.
- Accessibility for all users, including those with disabilities.

3. Functional Requirements

1. Biometric Enrollment:
